You may be thinking... **Why set a resume in github?** I never really thought of that... ever. Until [ArthurChamz](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/ArthurChamz) told me it was a good idea to set up the code for it in github.

And come to think of it... it is a really cool idea. The resume is constantly getting upgrades, fonts, images, and overall getting sexier. 

So I built one [here](https://github.com/claudiordgz/resume). Which can be seen [here](http://claudiordgz.github.io/resume/release/ResumeGeneric.pdf). 

It is a good thing I started this, since the resume is filled with so many colors that my Aurora PDF Viewer gets down to his knees from rendering the thing.

So click on the bear if you want to test a render of the resume on your browser... let me know how much it took in the comments.
