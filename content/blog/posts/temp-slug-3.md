###Intro.

Some women just don't know what to gift their guys. That is understandable, we are just story-hearing crunching bags, and that's fine. But it seems unreasonable that for us gifting that awesome thing you wanted your entire life but didn't realize it until we gifted it to you is just so easy, and yet you struggle when the same time comes for us. Then again, I remember Homer Simpson gifting a bowling ball to Marge. 

I just think it sucks having to put up with unnecessary stress that we didn't even meant to cause.

So that is why I am writing this for my wife, so she knows, or at least has an idea, for HOW TO pick awesome gifts for me, and for any guy, woman ever.

####Know your person

You gotta know what are the life's objectives of the person you are going to give a gift to. I am extremely easy in that sense, I want books, testing boards, computers, electronic equipment, powertools, the list goes on, but the question is why do I want all that.

My life around the house is pretty empty. I don't have a color changing window. There is no music in every room connected to my cellphone. I can't watch the same show in my kitchen and then go to my dinner table and keep watching from where I left. There is not enough space for my books, nor a bed for my dogs, nor my daughter's plushies. You might say it's all rich people's problems, but then again, you are going to have problems anyway. If you problems revolve around basic things like not having a girlfriend, I suggest asking the hundreds of people that don't have those problems how are they solving that specific problem and maybe, just maybe, their solution applies to you. 

> Never confuse unhappy with an unquenched thirst of absolute comfort. I could keep improving stuff even if it killed me.  

Most people in the world enjoy what they do in their free time. That is why it is so hard gifting things to people that don't do anything with their time except watching tv and not get paid to do it, I call these people the **Boring People**. If you find someone who lives of watching tv and gets paid to do it, write a book about it... like... now.  

> The great thing about boring people is that you don't have to gift them anything since they don't gift anything to the world. Your mere presence is more than enough.

But finding people's life objectives is really hard. 

<h3>Examples</h3>
What does you husband does for a living? Does he enjoys it? There are a few guys out there that their entire life revolves around their job. This is all right, that's how they like it. No, we are not aliens, we do love to work, and I know sometimes I may seem frustrated, but this is part of problem solving. So anything that improves our game is a great gift.&nbsp;
