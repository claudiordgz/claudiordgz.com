#Prologue

##A passerby of violence

As a reciprocating saw, a knife dug into the abdomen of the man. I kept walking. It was my third week on an internship in Nogales, Sonora. Before taking the position I had wild dreams of maintaining my retail business during the work week. I didn't know that walking was faster than the bus and that cab prices were astronomical at that time. 

Paying my water bill was a tactical operation that required finesse. I would sneak out of my work at 1535 sharp, pay no heed to the bodies covered in white blankets and the thick holes in the walls of a the retail company down in Av. de los Nogales. Drivebies were rare, dead bodies were a wonted commodity.  (31°16'26.1"N 110°55'50.4"W)

My monthly salary of 400 USD as an intern couldn't afford me a car. The second one of 250 USD as a retail guy couldn't afford me a car either. I would spend nearly two years designing my future.

I have to get out of this city. 

##Hometown

I was contacted when I graduated to go back to Nogales. Neither the job nor the city felt like home. People are rougher near violence, as if they felt more experienced, a common held misbelief. 

"The city is in chaos" I said with defeatist attitude as I looked down.
"You are just being dramatic" 
"I walked to the gym and the State Police's building is destroyed from yesterday's gunfight! A beheaded policeman appears on San Pedro with a note pinned to his check with a knife! Would you define that as drama?"
"Bad things happen every day" 

On June 2009 a corrupt politician started to clean house by burning down documents from his period, a common practice between politicians. It always worked, bulletproof. The fire `leaked` into the adjacent building... a daycare, then 44 toddlers died. Evidence was scarce, people were corrupted, scapegoats went to jail. The <strike>destroying of evidence</strike> accidental fire in the warehouse was only the tip of the iceberg, alarms, emergency exits, hydrants, fire extinguishers, they were all unchecked, unapproved, and would not live past a single audit. Audits did happened, same for everything else, at least in paper.

I have to get out of this city.   

##Bigger city, Bigger violence

I moved to Monterrey, and constant gunfights on the street would not disenchant me from changing my future. Drug business paid 7,000 pesos per murder. Had to constantly delude myself that someday I'll make honest money doing legal things.

Life moved on, I got married and had a daughter amidst all the violence. Our first home was in a bad neighborhood. Cops & Robbers would play they game near Rio Nazas, a street I would walk to get to my bus every day.   

We were given a car circa the end of 2012, I couldn't afford it with my monthly salary of 1000 USD. We started to slowly drown in debt, quicksand would have been a swifter death. 

I became a relentless Software Developer, absorbing everything I could. I would not pursue any other profession, and would not look for extra money in an unrelated second job. Around 2014 I changed companies and moved to 1500 USD. Mean wage in Mexico is circa 10,000-15,000 a year. Violence subsided those days and we moved to a better home.

I went to an Amazon Interview somewhere around the end of 2014. I wasn't ready. In retrospect I should have finished The Pragmatic Programmer and The Mythical Man Month before going. Knowing everything about maps, red black trees, radix sort, and a whole plethora of data structures and algorithms can only get you so far. Knowing how to flesh out ideas quickly and knowing all those things too can make you a very powerful developer.  

Then I was contacted with what seemed the opportunity of a lifetime. Little did I know that I would discover the lies and deceits of another country.

#Introduction

##Software Development

It is estimated that $5 trillion USD wiped out in paper wealth on Nasdaq from 2000-2002 during the Dot Com bubble burst.

During the 90s business changed fundamentally in Tech that eventually caused its **first** implosion. Company value was given by its customer base, this led to a corruption of business in which companies would berserk into expanding their user base through ads in every possible media outlet. Those companies that expanded by investing heavily into providing a better service that would bring value to their users became huge (Google, Amazon) and those that expanded through media outlets died (Lycos, Boo, Netscape). 

Computer Science jobs slowed down after the bubble burst, but a new way of business was born that did not depended on quality, features, usefulness, or service. The business of fame.

Software became a rockstar during that time, went into rehab for a couple of years, then came back as a Massive Supernova.

A second bubble is theoretically happening as of 2010 beginning with Social Media, Startups, and money being poured without paying attention to having a good product. 

##Visas

H1-B visas are usually the predominant discussion when talking about problems with Visas [[1]](http://www.epi.org/blog/new-data-infosys-tata-abuse-h-1b-program/), [[2]](http://insights.dice.com/2013/05/20/a-guest-workers-perspective-on-h-1bs/). Cases about Software Developers battling big companies to get overtime pay have become high profile in some cases. [[3]](http://carterlawfirm.net/results/)

There are many arguments against bringing outside workers, most of them would require a case by case basis. H1-B workers do tend to be cheaper to their american counterparts. Whether H1-B are the "best of the best" is usually a fallacy, [one proof of this is the case against Infosys in 2013 where Jack Palmer sued the company for harassment and alleged that the company would try to find ways to *trick* the system of the H1-B visa.](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304200804579163604195741612)

In 1988 a new visa category was created for specific Professionals, available only to citizens of Canada and Mexico, under the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The TN Visa (Treaty NAFTA) was recognized as of 1994. There are slight differences between an H1-B visa and a TN visa. A person with a valid profession can request one with a letter of employment with certain specific stipulations. Whereas the H1-B needs to be requested by the sponsor company. 

A TN visa is easier, cheaper, and faster to obtain than the H1-B. I obtained a TN Visa in a matter of two days, renewing was the same process. This makes it easy to streamline into a manufacturing process. As the H1-B visa issues have proven, money will always flow towards opportunity, as long as it's *legal*, then it is ok. Like Bestiality in Texas.

During the course of this text I will present you my case and what happened with my experience coming to the United States of America with my Family.
