## Motivation

The Study Series is an open source project with the main goal to help researchers get their message to the world, get some marketing for them, and finally get some revenue from placing ads in it. The idea came from some friends research, and some theses I dug out of the library. Furthermore, most researchers get out to the workforce and work on something unrelated to their research. While some of them may end up falling out of their research due to exhaustion, most of them fall out because of market situations, money needs, and lack of interest from the community in their research because the current geographical location does not represent the target audience for that research.

I feel this is unnecessary, and furthermore a waste of good workforce. I also dislike that salaries are driven by negotiation skills and swag when there are people out there who are devoted to some subject and hasn't have the time to dedicate massive amounts of time to their social engineering. I don't intend to educate people, I just want to get their message out there, and allow them to read a better target audience.

While organizations such as IEEE and ACM are doing wonderful jobs to help these individuals get their message out there, they are still very specific channels of communication that don't help improve our researchers economical lifestyle.
