I started the Silo Saga back in 2012, a saga that started with Wool back in 2011. The story deals with the adventures of Juliette in a post apocalyptic world were society lives in a Silo underground. The outside world, ravaged and destroyed, contains deadly contaminants that kills anyone who breaths them. Last month I finished the saga and I was surprised that I couldn't get around to finish it since 2013.
