I was in the middle of a post... writing and editing for almost one hour... When suddenly the blog came crashing down.

Now I remember the post about [redundancy from Netflix](http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/04/lessons-netflix-learned-from-aws-outage.html). 

Anyway... here is what I feel every day I leave my baby at the daycare.

And also what I felt when I lost my blog for almost 48 hours now.
